= Enabling wireless support on the DB410c and Raspberry Pi

Both WiFi and Bluetooth support on either the 96boards DragonBoard 410c or the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B or B+ need support files for either the WiFi or Bluetooth to work well. To install the files run the following commands, `brcm-firmware` for Raspberry Pi or `wcn36xx-firmware` for the Dragonboard and reboot which will enable the various wireless support:

*Raspberry Pi*:

----
$ sudo curl https://fedora.roving-it.com/wireless.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/wireless.repo
$ sudo rpm-ostree install brcm-firmware
$ sudo systemctl reboot
----

*Dragonboard*:

----
$ sudo curl https://fedora.roving-it.com/wireless.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/wireless.repo
$ sudo rpm-ostree install wcn36xx-firmware
$ sudo systemctl reboot
----
