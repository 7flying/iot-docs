= Container support

We currently ship the podman daemon as it's quite light weight and doesn't use a lot of resources. The commands are very similar to that of docker. Some sample commands are:

----
podman pull fedora

podman images

podman run -it --rm fedora /bin/bash
----

Podman has a lot of well written documentation and articles you can find a number of them at the following links:
