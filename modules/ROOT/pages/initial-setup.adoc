= Initial Setup once the VM or Physical device is running

IMPORTANT: There must be either a serial console or HDMI monitor with USB keyboard connected to the device to complete the initial setup.

== Create a User

The provided image has a locked root account. 
No password has been set and logging into the system, locally or remotely, with the root account is not allowed.

The first time the image is booted, an initial setup screen will appear.

Follow the prompts on the screen to create a standard user.

Continue selecting options to set a user name. 
When you select 'Use password' a new menu option will appear to set the password.

Ensure that the user will have root privileges by selecting the 'Administrator' option. 
This will add the user to the wheel group. 
Members of the wheel group can use `sudo` with any command by default.

Once the user is created, press `c` to continue at each prompt until the system continues to boot.

== Access a root Shell

Once the initial setup dialog has completed, login as the new user and use `sudo` to gain root privileges. 

----
[testuser@localhost ~]$ sudo -i
----

A prompt for the user password will appear. 
If the user was added to the wheel group, the correct user password will result in an interactive root shell. 
Be sure to `exit` when the root privilege is no longer needed.

If you wish to, you can set a root password, otherwise the root account remains locked and all access must be initiated by a standard user. 
Unless you have a specific need for direct root access, leaving the root account locked is recommended.
