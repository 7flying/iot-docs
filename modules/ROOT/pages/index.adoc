= Welcome

Welcome to Fedora Internet of Things. This is the home to the documentation for the Fedora Internet of Things objective.

== Communications

We primarily communicate by the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/iot.lists.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora IoT mailing list] and the #fedora-iot IRC channel on FreeNode.

== Tracking of development

We have a pagure group for https://pagure.io/group/fedora-iot[Fedora IoT] where we have various git repositories for the various components of Fedora IoT. This includes a https://pagure.io/fedora-iot/issues[core issue tracker].

There's also a https://tree.taiga.io/project/nullr0ute-fedora-iot/[Fedora IoT Kanban board] too where we will be tracking development, feature requirements, sprints and other related things.
