= Moving between stable and development nightly build trees

To move between the stable (Fedora 29 based) and the development (Fedora 30/Rawhide based) OSTrees use the following procedures.

Update the release key to the version you wish to move to:

----
sudo vi /etc/ostree/remotes.d/fedora-iot.conf
----

You need to specify the architecture. At the moment the options are aarch64 or x86_64.

To rebase to stable:

----
sudo rpm-ostree rebase -b fedora/stable/<ARCH>/iot
----

To rebase to devel:

----
sudo rpm-ostree rebase -b fedora/devel/<ARCH>/iot
----
