== Setup with QEMU/KVM Tools
The images generated are compressed raw disk images. They can be utilized both on physical devices and used as disks on a virtualization platform. The images work without change on QEMU/KVM.

On QEMU/KVM the tools that can be used to run the image in a VM include http://virt-manager.org/[Virtual Machine Manager^, role="ext-link"] or `virsh` command line utility. These tools are available in most Linux distributions. 

Decompress the image as below and then create a new virtual machine. 

----
$ xz -d Fedora-IoT-[version].raw.xz
----

When asked for an installation source or storage location, point the tool at the existing disk image.

When your image begins booting, continue with the xref:initial-setup.adoc[Initial Setup] instructions.

To learn more about the libvirt family of tools used in Fedora, visit the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/getting-started-with-virtualization/[Getting started with virtualization] section of the Fedora Documentation.

QEMU (on Linux hosts only) also supports user mode emulation. In this mode, QEMU can launch Linux processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU. Learn more in the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/qemu/[How to use QEMU] section of the Fedora Documentation.

== Setup with GNOME Boxes

While GNOME Boxes is based on `libvirt`, it does not support all of the features and it does not recognize the raw image format. The images we produce need to be converted to to a QCOW2 format. This can be done with the `qemu-img` command found in the `qemu-img` package. 

Decompress and convert the image as below and then create a new virtual machine.

----
$ xz -d Fedora-IoT-[version].raw.xz
$ qemu-img convert -f raw Fedora-IoT-[version].raw -O qcow2 Fedora-IoT-[version].qcow2
----

When asked for an installation source or storage location, point the tool at the existing disk image.

Image should be modified with an outline around the "Select a file" option

When your image begins booting, continue with the xref:initial-setup.adoc[Initial Setup] instructions.

Alternately, you can install a new box from the ISO image.

Link to new (still to be created) page to show ISO install. 
SilverBlue has an example with lots of screenshots for the F28 Anaconda install.
It probably has a lot more on manual partitioning than is needed here. 
Their intro NOTE is nice in pointing out that it is written in detail, assuming previous Fedora experience.

More information on using GNOME Boxes can be found in the https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-boxes/stable/index.html.en[GNOME HELP^, role="ext-link"] pages.

== Setup with VirtualBox

The images we produce need to be converted to be used with VirtualBox. This can be done with the `qemu-img` command found in the `qemu-img` package.

Decompress and convert the image as below and then create a new virtual machine.

----
$ xz -d Fedora-IoT-[version].raw.xz
$ qemu-img convert -f raw Fedora-IoT-[version].raw -O vdi Fedora-IoT-[version].vdi
----

When asked for an installation source or storage location, point the tool at the existing disk image.
