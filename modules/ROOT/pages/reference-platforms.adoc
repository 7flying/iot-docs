= Reference Platforms

For the moment Fedora supports the x86_64 and aarch64 architectures, the components to support ARMv7 are being worked upon and will be added shortly.

The currently tested reference devices are as follows:

* x86_64 and aarch64 VMs
* Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
* 96boads Dragonboard 410c
* 96boards Rock960 Consumer Edition

Other devices should work but aren't being actively tested in the context of IoT. The list of supported reference devices will expand with time.

== Required resources

The images being created are currently 4 Gb in size. The current memory used for testing is 1 Gb of RAM although Fedora IoT base image should run with less but of course this limits the amount of container applications can be run on top of the Base OS.
