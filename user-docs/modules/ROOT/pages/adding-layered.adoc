= Layered Packages

The Fedora IoT images utilize `rpm-ostree` which is a hybrid image/package system.
This allows layering a package on an existing image which produces a new versioned deployment. 
Similarly, removing a layered package creates a new versioned image.
The rpm-ostree utility keeps two deployments available so a rollback procedure can be used to revert to a previous deployment.
